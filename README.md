## Summary of the analysis: 
The main drawbacks of this website are it's not as versatile there is no way for someone to sort the information they are viewing. If we were able to add a click to sort functionality here this would help our users to categorize the data they are viewing better. I also feel it would be beneficial to allow the filters to filter for more of a range in text. It's likely that a user may input the city or state with a capital letter but we currently would show no results for this.
